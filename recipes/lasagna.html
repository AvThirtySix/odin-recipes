    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Meat:</strong>This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground<br>
        beef.</li>
      <li><strong>Onion and garlic:</strong>An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the<br>
        meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
      <li><strong>Tomato products:</strong>You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of<br>
        tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
      <li><strong>Sugar:</strong>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance<br>
        the flavor of the sauce.</li>
      <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong>This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley,<br>
        dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
      <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
      <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra<br>
        decadent.</li>
      <li><strong>Egg:</strong>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when<br>
        you cut into it.</li>
    </ul>










    <h4>Step 1</h4>
        cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat<br>
        until well browned.
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with<br>
        sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel<br>
        seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling<br>
        water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
        In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons<br>
        parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
    <h4>Step 6</h4>
        To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking<br>
        dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly.<br>
        Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella<br>
        cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with<br>
        1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
    <h4>Step 7</h4>
        Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover<br>
        with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure<br>
        the foil does not touch the cheese.
    <h4>Step 8</h4>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an<br>
        additional 25 minutes.
    <h4>Step 9</h4>
        Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
